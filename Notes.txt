API or Application Programming Interface:
    It is a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk
    to each other.

The REST Architecture:
    1. Separate API into logical resources: Any information that can be named is a resource. (users, tours, reviews)

    2. Expose structured resource-based URL's: Endpoints should only contain resources(nouns) and use HTTP methods for actions. 

    3. Use HTTP methods (verbs): Endpoints like /getNewTour should not be used and instead use something like GET /tours/:id. 
        (Resource should be always plural)

    4. Send data as JSON: Main difference between JSON and Object is that in JSON all keys must be strings.

    5. Be stateless: All state should be handled by the client. This means that each request must contain all the
        information necessary to process a certain request. The server should not have to remember previous requests.

MongoDB

    In mongoDB, data is stored in BSON format. It is like JSON but typed. So MongoDB documents are typed.
    Embedding/Denormalizing is the process of including related data into a single document. This allows for
    quicker access and easier data models.
    In the case of relational databases however, denormalization is not possible.

Mongoose
    Mongoose is an Object Data Modelling (ODM) library for mongoDB and node.js, a higher level of abstraction.
